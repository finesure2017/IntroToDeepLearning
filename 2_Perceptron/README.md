# Setup Test
This session introduced TensorFlow for fully connected artificial neural networks.

The code for this session requires Python, Numpy, Matplotlib and TensorFlow.  Python can be obtained from <a href="python.org">python.org</a>.  We recommend pip (distributed with Python) for installation of the others.

Once you have downloaded the .py files in this directory, you can test your installation using:

```python
python mnistExample.py
```

If you see the following output, your installation of TensorFlow is completed.
```
