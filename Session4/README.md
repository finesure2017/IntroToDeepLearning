# Session 4 - Machine Learning With Uncertain Bounds
This workshop introduces fully convolutional neural networks and illustrates the importance of using machine learning itself to do as much of the work as possible.  As an example problem, we will be trying to locate and identify handwritten characters randomly placed on an arbitrary sized page.

The code for this session requires Python, Numpy, Matplotlib and TensorFlow.  Python can be obtained from <a href="python.org">python.org</a>.  We recommend pip (distributed with Python) for installation of the others.

Once you have Python installed, you can install the required modules with the following commands:

```pip install Numpy```

```pip install Matplotlib```

```pip install TensorFlow```

If you installed TensorFlow prior to July 1, 2016, use the command:

```pip install --upgrade TensorFlow```

to grab the latest version. 

Also make sure you download the .py files in this directory.  If you've got a copy of TensorFlowInterface.py from a previous session, make sure you grab this one as it has some new bits.
